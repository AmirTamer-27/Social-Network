# 🌐 Social Network Friend Recommendation System

A graph-based social network application built for a Data Structures course project. The system mimics the "People You May Know" feature by recommending friends to users based on mutual connections and their position in the social graph.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

This project implements a simplified social network where users can:
- Create connections (friendships) with other users.
- View their current list of friends.
- Get **friend recommendations** based on:
  - **Mutual friends** (shared neighbors in the graph).
  - **Second-degree connections** (friends of friends).
- Visualize the relationship graph and explore user networks.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Graph Data Structure**:
  - Each user is a **node**.
  - Friendships are represented as **edges** between nodes.
- **Friend Recommendation Algorithm**:
  - Suggests users who share the most mutual connections.
  - Prioritizes second-degree relationships (friend-of-a-friend logic).
- **Graph Traversal Techniques**:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find connections.
  - Degree analysis for recommendation scoring.
